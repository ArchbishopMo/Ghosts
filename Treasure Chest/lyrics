through the window of this cage
sunlight pours in every morning
and it fills me with warmth and grace
but I just can't keep holding on like this

there's a hole in my bed
where your soul should be in my head

but your memories are kept 
in a treasure chest safe from the world
labeled: I once loved this girl

your memories are kept 
in a treasure chest safe from the world
labeled: I once loved this girl

there's a bell-jar full of dreams
and the broken-hearted reach for it
to drown out their screams

there's a pockket full of hope
but when you dig down to the bottom
it's just six feet of rope

there's an old, old saying:
time heals everything
guess I'll just keep playing until it comes true
till then 

your melodies are kept 
in a treasure chest safe from the world
labeled: I once loved this girl

your memories are kept 
in a treasure chest safe from the world
labeled: I once loved this girl

through the window of this cage
moonlight pours in with the night air
and it holds me in warm embrace
promising: it doesn't end here

there's a ghost of you always by my side
what a cruel thing to do to leave it behind 
when you left you took the key 

and now your memories are kept 
in a treasure chest safe from the world
labeled: I once loved this girl
